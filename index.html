    <p style="padding: 5px; "> The past few weeks that I have been here at AkiraChix have been full of ups and downs. Mostly ups because everyone is so nice and warm.The downs are more about myself as I tried to adjust to the new environment. Other than that I am having a great time learning and interacting with smart women from different backgrounds 
        and countries.The classes are amaizing with great trainers who have shown as nothing but support. The staff are also very nice and ready to make everyoe feel at home.
        I like the food, the environment the people and the energy of the place. The classes are fun and interactive which made learning easy and enjoyable.   </p>
